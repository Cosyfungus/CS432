                    <span class="designation">Co-Founder &amp; CEO</span>
                    <div class="text frame">
                        <p>Steve Huffman is the co-founder and CEO of Reddit, an online community of communities. On Reddit, there is a home for everybody and a place for everyone to dive into their interests.  

Raised in northern Virginia, Huffman pursued his passion for programming from an early age and followed it through a computer science degree at the University of Virginia. He and his college roommate pitched their first start-up to then-new incubator Y Combinator in 2005. While the pair&#039;s initial idea for a food-ordering mobile app called My Mobile Menu was rejected, Y Combinator founders Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston invited them back to build the front page of the internet, which soon led to the creation of Reddit. 

After selling the company in 2006, Huffman co-founded the travel company Hipmunk and served as CTO where he was named to Inc. Magazine&#039;s “30 Under 30” list in 2011 and the Forbes “30 Under 30” list in 2012. Huffman returned to Reddit as CEO in 2015 where he has led the company through international expansion to new markets, sweeping updates to the platform’s Content Policy, and a full site redesign, while also growing Reddit to millions of daily users interacting across hundreds of thousands of communities. In the years following his return, Huffman was named in Fortune’s “40 under 40 in Tech” for 2020. 

In addition to his work and leadership at Reddit, Huffman is a mentor at Hackbright Academy, a San Francisco-based coding school for women. In his free time, he enjoys skiing, dancing, and browsing r/WholesomeMemes.</p>

                <div class="text frame">
                    <p>Steve Huffman is the co-founder and CEO of Reddit, an online community of communities. On Reddit, there is a home for everybody and a place for everyone to dive into their interests.  

Raised in northern Virginia, Huffman pursued his passion for programming from an early age and followed it through a computer science degree at the University of Virginia. He and his college roommate pitched their first start-up to then-new incubator Y Combinator in 2005. While the pair&#039;s initial idea for a food-ordering mobile app called My Mobile Menu was rejected, Y Combinator founders Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston invited them back to build the front page of the internet, which soon led to the creation of Reddit. 

After selling the company in 2006, Huffman co-founded the travel company Hipmunk and served as CTO where he was named to Inc. Magazine&#039;s “30 Under 30” list in 2011 and the Forbes “30 Under 30” list in 2012. Huffman returned to Reddit as CEO in 2015 where he has led the company through international expansion to new markets, sweeping updates to the platform’s Content Policy, and a full site redesign, while also growing Reddit to millions of daily users interacting across hundreds of thousands of communities. In the years following his return, Huffman was named in Fortune’s “40 under 40 in Tech” for 2020. 

In addition to his work and leadership at Reddit, Huffman is a mentor at Hackbright Academy, a San Francisco-based coding school for women. In his free time, he enjoys skiing, dancing, and browsing r/WholesomeMemes.</p>
