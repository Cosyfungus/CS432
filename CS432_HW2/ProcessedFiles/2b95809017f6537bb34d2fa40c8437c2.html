What is Web Science?
The World Wide Web is the largest information system in history. In thirty years, it has transformed the world, affecting the everyday lives of billions of people across the planet by reshaping business practice, social interaction and cultural expression. Its expansion into massive online platforms that collect and process data (Google, Amazon, Facebook) drives the Digital Economy and powers advances in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
Web Science, which began in 2006 as a joint initiative between the University of Southampton and MIT, is the interdisciplinary academic study of this transformational impact. One of its initial themes was the emergence of large-scale social data platforms; as Web platforms have expanded their scope and influence Web Science correspondingly focused on the role of data in society and the possibilities of ubiquitous human-centred AIs.
