Inspiring customer stories
“I was very impressed with the way Zoom structured their chat solution. When I found out that we had free access to Zoom Team Chat with our business licenses, I thought, ‘That’s perfect!’ We implemented Zoom [Meetings] and Zoom Team Chat at the same time, and everybody just loved it.”
Peter Pacuch Senior Manager, IT Operations | Conexiom
“We had multiple chat solutions in play and users were split between them, but we started funneling everyone toward using Zoom Team Chat, and that has helped us simplify our software portfolio.”
Michael Shea Chief Information Officer | McDermott Will & Emery
Read The Story
Zoom Team Chat is my preferred medium because it doesn’t clutter up my inbox, I can tag people, and it’s real-time. We use Zoom Team Chat in IT all day, every day, so we can address those IT issues more quickly. We also tweaked our settings so our chat messages automatically delete after 7 days, which helps us keep things secure.
Gary Zaino Director Of IT Operations | Goulston & Storrs
