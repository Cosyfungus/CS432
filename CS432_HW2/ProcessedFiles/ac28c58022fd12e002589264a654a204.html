GM ACCESSIBILITY
Chevy Accessibility: engineered to go forward
We’re committed to helping all drivers find more accessible vehicles. That’s why we’re always looking for clever, purposeful mobility solutions for drivers with disabilities, and their caregivers, to get through the day comfortably and efficiently. While our accessibility journey is just beginning, Traverse already offers innovative assistance features for a range of needs — because everyone deserves to travel with pride and peace of mind.
“We’re developing our pioneering efforts in removing barriers to allow our customers to get to what matters. In and out of vehicles."
– Carrie Morton, GM Chief Engineer of Accessibility
