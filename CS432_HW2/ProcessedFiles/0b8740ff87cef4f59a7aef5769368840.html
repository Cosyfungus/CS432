The WindFree™ unit delivers an air current that is under 0.15 m/s while in WindFree™ mode. Air velocity that is below 0.15 m/s is considered "still air" as defined by ASHRAE 55-2013 (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers). Select models are Energy Star® labeled. Proper sizing and installation of equipment is critical to achieve performance. Split system air conditioners and heat pumps (excluding ductless systems) must be matched with appropriate coil components to meet ENERGY STAR® criteria.
