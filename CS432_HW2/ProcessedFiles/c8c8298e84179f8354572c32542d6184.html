We view our efforts within 4 pillars:
We want all Zoomies to feel comfortable bringing their whole selves to work. Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) team leads our company-wide effort to bring greater diversity and inclusiveness to our people and products, from our recruiting and hiring practices to the accessibility of our platform.
Workforce
Workforce is about who and how we hire. We actively engage with external sourcing partners to invite the best and brightest talent from the broadest backgrounds to consider working at Zoom. We continuously take stock of how we evaluate candidates to ensure that they are getting a fair and equal opportunity to share their capabilities.
Marketplace
Our DEI Marketplace efforts are all about how we include and consider our customers, with the ultimate goal of creating better products and experiences with them in mind.
An example of our Marketplace efforts include leveraging our ERGs and strategic partners to provide feedback on product designs and features.
Workplace Community
Workplace is how Zoomies experience Zoom once
they are here. Do they feel a sense of belonging to the organization? Do they have an opportunity to build networks and connections outside of their day-to-day roles?
Examples of our Workplace efforts include our Employee Resource Groups, employee-driven, volunteer groups that foster DEI in the workplace and encourage employee engagement and support.
Community
Our DEI Community efforts are focused on how we do our part to make the world more equitable for all. In partnership with our internal teams and external strategic partners, we forge partnerships that advance our DEI mission and Zoom’s core value of Care.
We believe that caring for community means giving back — through the power of our product, philanthropy, people, policy advocacy, and voice. Our efforts are based on long-established values of care and commitment to resourcing leaders and organizations in our communities around the globe. Zoom Cares is our philanthropic and charitable arm that aims to make a positive difference in three core areas:
Education
We fund innovations that help enable access to high-quality education for all children.
Social equity
We fund innovations that help disrupt disparities in race, power, and wealth.
Climate change
We fund innovations that help decrease greenhouse gas emissions and create healthy communities for all.
