Get to know Zoom Huddles
Browsing huddles
View a variety of different huddles at a glance from your Zoom App. See how many people are in the huddle before you decide to join in on the conversation.
Interacting in a huddle
Participate in a huddle with video and audio controls. Choose when you’d like to be muted, turn all audio off, which disconnects your own audio, or stop your video.
Views to fit your workstyle
Choose to stay in expanded view, where you can see others participating in a huddle, or minimized view to keep an eye on when you want to talk with a coworker without using too much screen real estate.
Huddle connected chat channels
Each huddle comes with a dedicated Team Chat channel that dynamically maintains parity with messages sent in a huddle.
Conversations in a huddle
Once in a huddle, join existing Conversations happening or start your own Conversations. Conversations are a way to form smaller groups within a huddle. Give your Conversation a name, so others in your huddle can join in as well.
