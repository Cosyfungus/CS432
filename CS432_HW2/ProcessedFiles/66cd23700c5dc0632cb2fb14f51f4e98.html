If you think it’s overwhelming to evaluate new technology solutions and their providers, you’re not alone. Sorting through multiple vendors to learn their capabilities and benefits can be a job in and of itself. Thankfully, Gartner® simplifies this process with its in-depth analyses of modern technology solutions and recognizes those who stand out among the competition. The annual Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ report provides valuable insight into enterprise technology providers within specific markets and measures providers on their completeness of vision and ability to execute.
For the fourth time in a row, Zoom is named a Leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for unified communications as a service (UCaaS), Worldwide. We feel Gartner recognition reflects our ongoing dedication to the innovation of our UCaaS offerings, which include, Zoom Team Chat , Zoom Phone , Zoom Meetings , Zoom Whiteboard , and AI .
We believe our significant enhancements to solutions like Zoom Intelligent Director , Zoom Meetings (Smart Recordings, Human Avatars, Automotive support), Zoom Phone (survivability, new dashboards, international expansion), and the release of Zoom Mail, Zoom Calendar, and Zoom Scheduler contributed to our Magic Quadrant placement.
“We are excited to be named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for UCaaS for the fourth consecutive year, which we feel is a result of our ongoing commitment to offer an exceptional UCaaS experience,” said Graeme Geddes, Chief Growth Officer at Zoom. “As we continue to innovate and evolve our platform, we remain true to solving real customer problems and delivering limitless human connection.”
Zoom’s UCaaS platform gives your team the flexibility to communicate and collaborate wherever you want, however you need. In FY23, we accelerated our evolution into a unified collaboration platform, as evidenced by Zoom Phone’s stellar performance of surpassing 5.5 million seats by year-end. Now, we’re running the same playbook for Zoom Contact Center , which we launched in early FY23 and have greatly expanded its features, functionality, and integrations.
Our smart AI assistant, Zoom AI Companion , empowers individuals by helping them be more productive, connect and collaborate with teammates, and improve their skills. AI helps people work better, so we believe everyone should enjoy its benefits. That’s why AI Companion is available at no additional cost with the paid services in one’s Zoom user account.
Zoom’s AI-powered conversation intelligence solution, Zoom Revenue Accelerator , can help by easily bringing conversation intelligence into those sales interactions. Conversation intelligence opens up a new level of insight for your team by using AI to analyze data from sales conversations, arming sellers with meaningful information, such as how often certain competitors are being mentioned by prospects.
We invite you to read the entire 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for UCaaS , Worldwide report and learn why we’re a Leader among UCaaS providers.
