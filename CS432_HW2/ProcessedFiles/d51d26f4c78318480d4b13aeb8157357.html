How to change your Zoom Background
It’s easy to change your virtual background to an image - or even a video. Follow the steps below to get started. Pro tip: Update to the latest version of Zoom to see all options and filters.
Download an image or video of your choosing.
Compatible formats include GIF, JPG/JPEG, or PNG. We recommend an image with a 16:9 aspect ratio, and a minimum resolution of 1280x720 pixels.
Videos should be MP4 or MOV files with a minimum resolution of 480x360 pixels (360p) and a maximum resolution of 1920x1020 (1080p).
On the desktop app, navigate to Preferences in the settings menu. On the left side menu, go to Background & Filters.
You will then see Virtual Backgrounds, where you can choose from the preloaded options, or upload your own by clicking the plus (+) icon to the right of Video Filters.
You can choose either an image or a video as your background. You’ll see a library of the images and videos you’ve uploaded under Virtual Backgrounds.
To add or change your virtual background during a meeting, click on the upward arrow (^) next to Start/Stop Video. Click Choose Virtual Background, and select any of your backgrounds!
Top 3 tips for best Zoom Virtual Background results:
Tip 1
Leave “Mirror my video” checked. Words in your background will look backwards to you, but will read normally to the other meeting participants.
Tip 2
For the cleanest results, have a solid color in the background - or better yet, a green screen - so that your virtual background shows up clearly.
Tip 3
Don’t wear clothing the same color as your virtual background. No one wants to be a floating head!
Add some fun to calls with filters and stickers
Set the mood or add levity to calls with filters or stickers. You can access both from either the desktop app, or from within a meeting.
In the desktop app:
Go to Preferences > Background & Filters
You’ll see Virtual Backgrounds and Video Filters. Click on Video Filters
Within Video Filters, you can preview the filters, sticker backgrounds, or stickers that move with you, like a graduation cap, sunglasses, or even transform yourself into a unicorn!
You can also add filters and stickers during a meeting. Click on the upward arrow (^) next to Start/Stop Video. Click Choose Video Filter, and try out a new look.
Touch up your appearance and adjust for low light
If you don’t have the best lighting, or just want to brighten up your appearance, you’ll want to know about the touch up your appearance and lowlight settings.
To access both of these features from the desktop app, follow these simple steps:
Go to Preferences > Settings
Click Video in the left side navigation
Under My Video you’ll see check boxes for both Touch up my appearance and Adjust for low light. Both features will automatically adjust your video, but you can also manually adjust them using the slider
To touch up your appearance or lighting during a meeting, click on the upward arrow (^) next to Start/Stop Video. Click Video Settings, and easily adjust your video on the fly.
