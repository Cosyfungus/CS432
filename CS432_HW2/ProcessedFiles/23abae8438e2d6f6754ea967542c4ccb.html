Zoom meeting and phone systems work very well. Had no problems migrating our phone number, making and receiving calls, scheduling and attending meetings.
Nonetheless, Zoom has awful tech and billing support. Our invoices arrived with overage fees that aren't described. The billing support tickets are set to low priority, forcing us to pay the invoices before receiving a response. When responses are sent, they usually point to articles, instead of answering real questions. In the rare occasions somebody decides to answer, they put the blame on us, instead of explaining what the overages are. Reaching out to our sales manager is also useless.
Therefore, although the system works well, in case of  problems, you are on your own. It is pointless reaching out to their billing and tech support.
We'll migrate to another service the soonest. Can't stand invoices with charges we don't understand when we have an unlimited plan.
