The NFL today is almost like a different game compared to the way it was played back in the day. The players  were often bloody and muddy, the quarterbacks werenâ€™t treated like fragile primadonnas, and the logos and lore were legendary. If you are nostalgic for the Gridiron greatness of the past, this sub is for you.
