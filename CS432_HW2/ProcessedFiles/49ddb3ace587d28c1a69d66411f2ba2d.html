/r/lewronggeneration/
This is a subreddit dedicated to satirically mocking those people who, blinded by their own nostalgia, believe certain things in the past to be unequivocally better than today. We place a special emphasis on music, because this subreddit was created after annoyance over "born in the wrong generation" attitude often expressed by fans of 60s/70s rock.
