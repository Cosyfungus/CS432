Full of quirks and bugs
Lots of annoying bugs. On an up-to-date M1 iPad Pro. Canât use the margins to scroll ONLY in the home feed. Oftentimes and randomly, the back arrow when reading a post from any feed will not work, the back arrow completely disappears, or the back arrow will open some random media full-screen. When on the home feed, leave the app momentarily and go back into it, the home feed is scrolled back to the top instead of where you were. Sometimes wonât play media. Some media automatically unmutes when played, some donât - seems completely random. Randomly, the Home/Popular/News/Latest drop-down menu and the subscribed subs menu just disappears. Randomly, when trying to scroll down the home feed, the up swipes are interpreted as right swipes. In-app notification badge often does not automatically show up, must go into notifications tab and refresh. And oftentimes when clicking the title of a media post, it opens the media instead of going into the post. And when playing a video full screen the overlay doesnât go away on its own, you have to tap to make it go away. Most of these behaviors seemed to have started recently, with an update of some sort. Edit: Reddit recently cut off third party apps. Now you canât unsubscribe from subs and it doesnât respond to âshow fewer posts like thisâ. What a mess. Maybe fix your own app if youâre going to do this. App is still flaky and annoying to use with all these bugs!

Every time they fix one thing, they break three more.
Every time this app updates, it gets worse. They change useless things like the visuals of the buttons to save images and videos (if and when that works). On that note, for reasons unknown to man or beast, heaven or earth, they removed the ability to save GIFs. Itâs not the first time, and I assume sooner or later itâll be back and theyâll want praise for once again doing the absolute bare minimum. The ability to save videos almost never works either, unless you know the trick to go to comments, go back, press the save button again, and hope to your personal god *that* works. Even if it does work, for some reason the videos always save without sound. All of these used to be features that inexplicably are constantly removed, changed, replaced, and put back. Honestly, I donât know why this app, of all apps, needs to update this much. Especially when most of the changes are aesthetic and the ones that arenât always make things worse. I never got a chance to use any of the third-party apps, but I wish that I had. The only reason Iâm giving this two stars instead of one is so that people donât think that this is a fake review and it gets filtered out. This is a real review and real frustration from a real user. But itâs like the people who designed this app donât actually use it themselves. Just make things work and then leave it alone.
