AI Companion’s meeting summaries and smart recordings are the first technological innovations in the last decade that bring us tangible time-saving, efficient benefits. People can prioritize specific meetings and collaborations while remaining confident they aren’t missing out on competing activities.
Chris Blackstone Director, Digital Workplace and End User Computing, Convera
Zoom's AI Companion Meeting Summary tool is helping us become better communicators. Guided by its impressively accurate output, our teams are more consistently adhering to best practices in meetings such as stating the objective upfront and clearly outlining and assigning action items. Plus, we were able to save money by off-boarding a vendor and save time by not having to produce meetings notes ourselves.
Lucas Oliveira COO, Bizzycar, Inc.

Meeting summaries has saved our team a ton of time. We feel that everyone is in the loop without necessarily having to attend every meeting, which results in better collaboration.
Karl Morsgofian CIO at Gainsight
We're seeing a lot of positive feedback on [meeting summary]…being able to focus on the meeting, and then rely on something else to capture the essence of what happened in the tasks or next steps alleviates a lot of responsibility from our staff members. Just being present, being involved and collaborative in the meeting and not worrying about ‘wait, what do I need to do now?’ It's all there. It's ready to go.
