The University of Southampton is launching the new Web Science Institute today (11th November) to investigate how the World Wide Web is changing the world and the world is changing the Web.
The Web is the largest information system ever constructed and a social and technical phenomenon that has transformed the world and continues to do so in innovative and unexpected ways that will shape our future. We can’t predict how the Web will change our society, but Southampton has taken a lead in developing new forms of economic, social, political, technological and cultural resources based on a deep understanding of the Web's technologies and social construction.
The Web Science Institute (WSI) will act as a focal point, co-ordinating and putting into practice education, research and enterprise initiatives on web-related developments at the University of Southampton. Its aim is to secure a sustainable future for multi-disciplinary research across the University that has Web Science at its core by:
•	focusing on interdisciplinary collaborations and partnerships;
•	demonstrating clear ambition, adaptability and innovation;
•	leveraging the visionary leadership and outstanding staff and student expertise across the University;
•	providing a platform for significant investment by Government and external partners;
•	showcasing unique and creative education programmes that set new standards internationally.
The Institute will be directed by a multi-disciplinary team drawn from across the University and led by Web Science pioneers Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Professor Sir Nigel Shadbolt.
Professor Dame Wendy Hall says: “There is a ‘perfect storm’ brewing which combines open data, open education and open research, so this is a very exciting time to be launching the Web Science Institute.”
Professor Sir Nigel Shadbolt says: “The open data movement is one example of how the web is evolving, empowering individuals and communities to achieve phenomenal ends. The Web Science Institute will help us to understand this evolution.”
The other WSI Directors are Professor Leslie Carr from the Web Science DTC; Dr Graeme Earl from Humanities; Professor Susan Halford from Social and Human Sciences; and Dr Lisa Harris from Business and Law.
Web Science is the subject of the University’s first ever Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), which starts today. The Web Science MOOC, developed by WSI members in partnership with the Centre for Innovation in Technologies and Education (CITE) and Future Learn, will examine the origins and evolution of the Web, and consider key questions of security, democracy, networks and economy from both computational and social science perspective.
