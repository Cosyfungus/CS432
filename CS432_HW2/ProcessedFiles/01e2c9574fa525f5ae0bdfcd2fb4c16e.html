“This wasn’t just about creating a virtual conference. Code 2022 needed to highlight and showcase what we were doing on the ground and not become an entirely separate event or take away from the in-person experience. So partnering with Zoom in that capacity was really exciting for us.”
Tara Reilly VP of experiential and partnerships, Vox Media
“Zoom Events became a critical component in enabling the connection the team has with its fans. Oracle Red Bull Racing fans and partners will be able to virtually join unique hybrid experiences and events from wherever they are in the world.”
Christian Horner OBE Team Principal & CEO, Oracle Red Bull Racing
“We hosted a two-day hybrid conference, and Zoom Events gave our attendees the opportunity to participate virtually from anywhere. This took the factors of time, travel and cost off the table in evaluating in-person event attendance. As happy customers of Zoom Meetings, Rooms, and Phone, we knew we could rely on Zoom for an engaging, high-quality experience for all of our attendees. Zoom takes the stress out of producing hybrid events!”
Jen Ainsworth Director of Marketing — Business, Cooley, LLP
“We used Zoom Events to host our annual StreamGeeks summit this year. I’m so blown away by the platform and its ability to easily connect attendees and allow them to network and participate in many ways. This is powerful stuff and a true game changer for the industry.”
Paul Richards Chief Streaming Officer — StreamGeeks
“We used Zoom Events to host our Supplier Diversity Symposium because it enabled our suppliers to speak alongside our senior leaders. The platform was perfect for giving suppliers the flexibility to attend virtually while ensuring we could share information in an engaging way. It was easy to set up and launch, and is a great way to further strengthen our relationships with and commitment to minority and women-owned businesses.”
T.J. Lewis Head of Supplier Diversity — Ally Financial
