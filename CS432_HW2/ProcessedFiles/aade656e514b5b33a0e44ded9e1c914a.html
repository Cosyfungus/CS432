r/intermittentfasting
Intermittent Fasting (IF) is way of eating that restricts *when* you eat, usually on a daily or weekly schedule.  People engage in IF to reap the many benefits to health, fitness, and mental clarity.  This is a place to share success, support each other, ask questions, and learn.

IF is an 18+ community because the practice is not medically recommended to/for children.
