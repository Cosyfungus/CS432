Eight years before I was born, Apollo 17 returned from the moon (1972). I sadly missed the most exciting adventure humans have ever experienced. Since I was young I've dreamed of being able to witness the next big milestone. We've seen no further manned missions outside Low Earth Orbit in my years, but this is about to change with SpaceX and Blue Origin pushing humanity back into the new space race alongside NASA. This is an amazing time to be alive and I want to share all I can with you.
