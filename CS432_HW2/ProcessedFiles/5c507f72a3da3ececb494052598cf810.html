19. Research Roadmap
 By Nigel Shadbolt, Web Science Research Initiative - November, 2008
 A Computational Perspective
   – Linked Data Web or Semantic Web: how we are to browse, explore and
     query such a Web at scale.
   – Collective Intelligence with only light rules of social coordination
     can lead to the emergence of large-scale, coherent resources such as Wikipedia.
     What are the characteristics of such resources? Why do people contribute and how
     do they maintain a highly stable core body of connected content?
   – How do we support inference at a Web scale? What types of reasoning are
     possible? How is context represented and supported in Web inference?
   – How are concepts such as trust and provenance computationally
     represented, maintained and repaired on the Web?
   – As the Web has grown substantial amounts of it have become disconnected,
     atrophied or in others ways redundant. How are we to identify such necrotic
     and non-functional parts of the Web and what should be done about them?


                                         19
20. Research Roadmap
 A Mathematical Perspective
  – How do we model the transient or ephemeral Web? How do
    we model this graph beneath the graph that is the Web?
  – How are Bayesian or other uncertainty representations best
    used within the Web?
  – What is the topological structure of the Web? Can connections always
    be established between its various parts, or do particular dynamic and time-
    dependent conditions create disconnected or sub- regions within it?
  – The virtual “shape” of the Web: A particular query about a given subject
    may organize Web pages, existing or virtual, according to “how close they
    are” with respect to the given search criteria.
     • A different structure to different users. It is a mathematical challenge to develop
       tools to describe this structure.
  – How do we measure the level of complexity of the Web?


                                            20
21. Research Roadmap
 A Social Science Perspective
  – How can we develop inter-disciplinary epistemologies that will enable us to
    understand the Web as a complex socio-technical phenomenon?
  – How can we do mixed methods research to explore the relations between
    ethnographic insights to Web practice and the emergence of the Web at
    the macro level?
  – How can we draw on new data sources e.g. digital records of network use to develop
    understanding of the sociological aspects of the Web?
  – What are the on-going iterative relations between use and design of the Web?
  – How and why do people use newly emergent forms of the Web in the way
    that they do? What implications does this have for our understanding of key sociological
    categories, e.g. kinship, gender, race, class and community, and vice versa? What implications
    does this have for our understanding of psychological constructs, e.g. personal and group
    identity, collaborative decision making, perception and attitudes.
  – How is the Web situated within networks of power and in relation to social
    inequalities? To what extent might the Web offer empowering political resources? How
    might the Web change further as new populations access it?


                                               21
22. Research Roadmap
 An Economic Perspective
  – What are the economics of Web 2.0 (+)?
  – What are the economic forces that shape the formation of social
    networks on the Web? What are the properties of those networks? What is the
    relationship between the economic structure of the Web, its social and mathematical
    structure?
  – What are the commercial incentives created by the Web? What will be the
    industrial structure? Or are there forces that will allow smaller scale operations to co-
    exist with large ﬁrms?
  – What are the economic arguments for and against open platforms in
    the Web? Should policy (economic and public) play any role in shaping or determining
    the openness of Web platforms?
  – What (economic and social) mechanisms can be designed to improve the
    performance of the Web? For example, are there mechanisms that can improve
    the extent and quality of participation in online communities?
  – Economics for piracy, privacy and identity?

                                             22
23. Research Roadmap
 A Legal Perspective
  – Techniques for representing and reasoning over legal and social
    rules – explore and understand the impact of law as a driver in shaping the Web
    development?
  – Is the present intellectual property regulatory regime ﬁt for purpose in
    the Web 2.0 (+) environment? What is content in the Semantic Web and what rights
    should attach to it particularly when much is likely to be “computer generated”?
  – Which technologies within the Web should the law ensure remain “open” rather
    than becoming the “property” of one or more commercial entities and what are the
    consequences of the choices available?
  – To what extent are the service providers going to become the legal gatekeepers
    for public authorities in terms of delivering their public policy objectives e.g. Web
    policing for what is judged to be “illegal and harmful content”?
  – What privacy issues arise in a Web environment of increasingly sophisticated
    information sharing?
