Training Dataset
We use renders from the Objaverse dataset, utilizing our enhanced rendering method that more closely replicate the distribution of images found in the real world, significantly improving our modelâ€™s ability to generalize. We selected a carefully curated subset of the Objaverse dataset for the training data, which is available under the CC-BY license.
