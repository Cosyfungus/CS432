Frequently asked questions
What are Zoom Webinars?
Zoom Webinars allow you to connect with large audiences and share video, audio, and content from any location and device for better engagement. The simple interface allows you to plan, present, and host webinars at an affordable price. Zoom’s high-quality experience scales to up to 50,000 attendees and supports 1,000 interactive video panelists for a more engaging and interactive experience.

Can a host run multiple webinars at the same time?
No, concurrent live webinars are not supported by a single user license.
What's the difference between a Zoom Webinar and Large Meetings?
Webinars are built for presenting polished content to a large audience, whereas meetings are built for small to large team discussion and collaboration.
Large Meetings is an optional add-on for Zoom’s meeting plans to scale up to 1,000 live interactive participants. In large meetings, all participants can share their audio, video, and screen.
Webinars are used to host virtual presentations and broadcast them to a view- and listen-only audience. This reduces the risk of disruptions and is a safer choice for large audiences who join mostly to listen and learn.
Can a host run multiple webinars at the same time?
No, concurrent live webinars are not supported by a single user license.
Can a webinar have more registrants than the webinar plan size?
Yes, you can have unlimited registrations or you can set a registration limit, but the total number of attendees who can join a webinar concurrently is based on your Zoom Webinars plan (500, 1,000, etc.). Unlimited registrations are not available if you are using the PayPal integration to charge for tickets.
Is it easy for attendees to join?
Attending Zoom Webinars is as straightforward as clicking on a link. Webinar attendees do not need their own Zoom account to join a webinar. You can join through a browser or the Zoom client from any desktop, laptop, mobile device, or a Zoom Room.
How do I manage registrations in Zoom Webinars?

What are the security features of Zoom Webinars?
Our unified communications experience is built with security in mind. The Zoom Cloud is a proprietary global network that has been built from the ground up to provide quality communication experiences. . Zoom has a robust set of security features designed to help hosts manage and safeguard the webinar experience. A Zoom Webinar host may choose to manually approve or decline anyone who registers as well as remove an attendee or lock a webinar to prevent additional attendees from joining once the webinar has started. In addition, webinar hosts can require passcodes or set up authentication for an added layer of security. For more detailed information about Zoom security, please visit our Trust Center

How do I set up a Zoom Webinar?
Setting up Zoom Webinars is simple. It only takes minutes to set up through the Zoom web portal (just sign into zoom.us and click on the webinar tab on the left). You can add your brand to the registration, and customize your emails for each webinar, and immediately begin scheduling and hosting webinars.
What are the roles for a webinar?
Zoom Webinars offer various roles with different permissions.
The host owns the webinar license and has the most control over the webinar in how it is scheduled, how it is set up, who can share video and audio, who is invited to listen and learn and what features are available. The webinar host can also assign alternative hosts who can edit sessions.
The host can add a co-host as backup to help run and monitor the webinar session. The co-host has the same permissions as the host except scheduling and setting up the webinar.
The host can invite panelists who are able to share video, audio, and screen during the webinar.
Attendees can share audio if allowed by the host to ask questions directly in the webinar.
What reporting options are available?
There are registration and attendee reports to help you track leads and segment for follow- up communications. Performance reports display engagement statistics on registration, attendance, and feedback. Reports capture the webinar’s Q&A, polling, and post-webinar survey results. All reports are exportable as CSV files.
How do I manage registrations in Zoom Webinars?
Zoom Webinars offer a lot of flexibility for handling webinar registrations. There are three options for managing webinar registrations:
Select registration is not required; your invitees will be given a URL to join the webinar.
Select to automatically approve anyone who has registered for the webinar and Zoom provides them a confirmation email.
Manually approve attendees before Zoom sends out a confirmation email.
When setting up your webinar’s registration, you can add your brand logo to the registration page and the emails that get sent out. Zoom also makes it easy to add demographic fields and customized open ended or multiple-choice questions to the registration page.
Zoom Webinars integrates with many leading CRM systems, allowing you to generate leads from participants that joined a webinar or push contacts from your CRM system to a webinar registration page.
What is the max capacity for the number of people who can join a Zoom Webinar?
Participants in a Zoom Webinar include the host, alternative hosts, co-hosts, panelists, and attendees. These roles are defined in detail in this Help article. The max capacity for the number of concurrent live attendees is defined by the Zoom Webinar license held by the host. Concurrent live attendees join the webinar in listen and view-only mode and cannot see other attendees. The number of concurrent panelists a Zoom Webinar can support is determined by the host’s Zoom Meetings license. If a host has a Large Meetings license, then they can host a webinar with up to 500 or 1,000 panelists.
Are Zoom Webinars available worldwide?
Yes. Zoom has data centers on several different continents to ensure a quality experience globally. As long as you have a decent internet connection, you can participate in or attend Zoom Webinars from anywhere Zoom services are available. Zoom offers unlimited VoIP from any internet connection, and global dial-in (toll applies) for 55 countries. You can also subscribe to Premium Audio for toll-free calls from 120+ countries.
Do you support language interpretation?
Yes. Zoom’s language interpretation allows the host to designate panelists as interpreters on the web portal or during a Zoom session. When the webinar starts, the host can start the interpretation feature, which will give the interpreters access to their own audio channels. Attendees can select an audio channel to hear their language of choice. Attendees will hear the translated audio and can choose if they want to hear the original audio at a lower volume. Cloud recordings of interpretation sessions will only record the original audio of the meeting or webinar, not the translations. Local recordings of interpretation sessions will record any audio that the person recording can hear, but not multiple audio channels.
Is there an on-premise option?
Yes, you can use Zoom’s hybrid cloud service – known as the Zoom Meeting Connector – to deploy meeting communication servers within your company’s internal network. User and meeting metadata are managed in the public cloud while the webinar is hosted in your private cloud. All webinar traffic including video, voice, and content sharing goes through the on-premise Zoom Meeting Connector. Zoom Meeting Controller can be deployed onto any virtualization platform. Contact sales to learn more.
Do you offer plans for educational institutions?
Yes. Zoom provides subsidized educational institution pricing to empower educators around the world. Please contact sales
