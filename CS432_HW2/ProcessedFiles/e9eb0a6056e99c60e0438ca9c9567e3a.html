The items are usually good, sometime hit or miss. The shipping varies from halfway decent to horrible. The app is okay honestly. UPDATE: Dont download this, the returns are terrible. They seller literally has all the power, aliexpress confirmed it. The sellers dont have to provide anything when you return something, so if they want to rip you off, they will. I was stolen from and message 5 times and was denied a refund even though i gave proof i sent the items back. I'm furious
