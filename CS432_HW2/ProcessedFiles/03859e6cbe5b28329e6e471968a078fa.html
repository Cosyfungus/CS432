PBTfans is a brand new keycap manufacturer created by KBDfans with well-designed molds and bold, sharp consistent legends.
PBTfans has been envisioned to change the current development process of keycap group buys in the mechanical keyboard community. Normally, every keycap group buy requires participants to wait long periods of time as designers, vendors and manufacturers engage in lengthy back-and-forth communication to create a finalized product. With PBTfans, we hope to change the game and help the community get their keycaps faster. We will complete all necessary processes before keycap sets even enter group buy (including color-matching and sample confirmation with the designer, obtaining all required information from vendors, etc.) Communication to create a finalized product. With PBTfans, we hope to change the game and help the community get their keycaps faster.
Our mission is to make this community better than ever. We welcome collaborations with designers who have the same goal in mind. Peace and love!
