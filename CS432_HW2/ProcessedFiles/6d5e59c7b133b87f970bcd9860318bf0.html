Creator basics: how to set up and customize
                                  your channel
There are a few ways to get started on YouTube. We
                              offer up different formats and functionalities,
                              giving you the flexibility to create everything
                              from Shorts, which are vertical videos that run 60
                              seconds or less, to longer form videos.
No matter what youâre creating, youâll need to
                              start by creating a YouTube Channel.
First you need to sign into YouTube using a
                                Google Account.
Once youâre signed in, click âCreate Accountâ,
                                and choose whether itâs for you or for your
                                business.
You can then create a YouTube channel on your
                                account, upload videos, leave comments, and
                                create Shorts and playlists.
Next, youâll want to upload your videos!
Uploading is easy. You just sign into your
                                YouTube account and then click on the âCreateâ
                                icon.
If youâre planning to upload a longer form
                                video, select âupload videoâ and then choose
                                your desired video file - you can upload 15
                                files at a time!
If youâd like to upload a YouTube Short , youâll need to be signed into YouTube mobile,
                                where youâll tap âCreateâ and then âCreate a
                                Shortâ. From here you can either upload a video
                                from your camera roll or create using our suite
                                of lightweight tools.
Help your videos stand out & keep viewers
                                  watching
Growing your channel is all about creating videos
                              viewers want to watch and accurately presenting
                              them to the audience. When doing so, hereâs a few
                              tips to keep in mind.
With each video, think carefully about the title,
                              description, and thumbnail you plan to use - these should all accurately
                              reflect your content and let viewers know what
                              they can expect from the video. If youâre a Shorts
                              creator, think about how the first 1-2 seconds of
                              your content can grab viewers scrolling through
                              the video feed!
Once youâve got viewers watching, you can redirect
                              their attention via hashtags, playlists , cards , end screens , and more.

Promoting your videos
Promoting your videos is all about getting the
                              word out there. On YouTube, you can use tools like
                              cards, end screens, Stories, and Community Posts
                              to drive viewers to a specific piece of content!
Off-platform, think about promoting your videos on
                              your socials and relevant communities, podcasts,
                              or platforms that align with your content and your
                              intended audience.

How YouTube recommends videos using "the
                                  algorithm"
Our search and discovery systems are built to find
                              videos that match viewersâ individual interests.
                              We recommend videos based on things such as: what your audience
                              watches and doesnât watch, how much time they
                              spend watching, what they like and dislike, if
                              they mark a video as ânot interestedâ, and on
                              satisfaction surveys.
So, rather than trying trying to find a secret
                              code to these systems, focus instead on making
                              videos that you think will resonate with your
                              audience. A great tool here is YouTube Analytics,
                              which provides data that can help you understand
                              how your existing content is performing and
                              provide insights for future videos!
