Commerce, education, entertainment and individuals have embraced the potential of the world wide web and seen revolutionary benefits as they the way they operate. Indeed the users of the web have influenced the development of the web, co-creating it in the form which it exists today.Can Health provision and education move into the area of the web and create an environment where individuals and communities become more responsible for their own health and where possible, treatment? There has been increasing interest internationally in E-Health, Health 2.0, Medicine 2.0.
