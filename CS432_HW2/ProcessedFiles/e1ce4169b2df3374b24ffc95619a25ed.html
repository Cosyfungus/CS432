/r/CoronavirusDownunder/
This subreddit is a place to share news, information, resources, and support that relate to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes called COVID-19. The primary focus of this sub is to actively monitor the situation in Australia and New Zealand, but all posts on international news and other virus-related topics are welcome, to the extent they are beneficial in keeping those down under informed.

/r/vaccinelonghauler/
This reddit is for people who have received one or more Covid 19 vaccines and are having long term / long haul  side effects "from an mRNA vaccine" that are similar to the effects of long haul Covid infection  itself.   After 2-3 months if your side effects still persist I feel it would be considered vaccine injury. 

We would like to hear from people that received Pfizer, Moderna, Astrazeneca and J&J

This reddit is only for pro-vaccine comments  all antivaxx comments will be deleted
