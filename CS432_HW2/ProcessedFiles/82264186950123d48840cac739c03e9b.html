Web Science Institute
We combine expertise in web science, data science and artificial intelligence to study the relationship between society and the largest information system in history: the World Wide Web.
The web has transformed our business practices, the way we interact socially and our cultural expression. We explore the challenges and opportunities it brings to society, from issues around privacy and data to the notion of trust in artificial intelligence. Our researchers collaborate across social, computational and natural sciences, humanities, medicine, health, business and law. We coordinate the University's membership of The Alan Turing Institute.
