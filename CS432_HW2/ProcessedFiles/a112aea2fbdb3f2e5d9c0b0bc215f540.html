Zoom for Government vs. commercial Zoom
In the United States, we offer a separate platform, called Zoom for Government (ZfG), that is designed to conform with the federal government’s security requirements. While originally created for federal agencies, ZfG is also available to U.S. state and local government customers as well as other approved businesses and organizations.
Zoom for Government delivers an intuitive and secure experience similar to commercial Zoom. Both versions of the platform are scalable and flexible, giving today’s public sector organizations what they need to achieve their goals while still helping to protect important information.
