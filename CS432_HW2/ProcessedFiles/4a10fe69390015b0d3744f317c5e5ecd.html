Select your preferences and run the install command. Stable represents the most currently tested and supported version of PyTorch. This should
   be suitable for many users. Preview is available if you want the latest, not fully tested and supported, builds that are generated nightly.
   Please ensure that you have met the prerequisites below (e.g., numpy),  depending on your package manager. Anaconda is our recommended
   package manager since it installs all dependencies. You can also install previous versions of PyTorch . Note that LibTorch is only available for C++.
NOTE: Latest PyTorch requires Python 3.8 or later. For more details, see Python section below.
PyTorch Build
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
Installing on macOS
PyTorch can be installed and used on macOS. Depending on your system and GPU capabilities, your experience with PyTorch on a Mac may vary in terms of processing time.
Prerequisites
PyTorch is supported on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or above.
Python
It is recommended that you use Python 3.8 - 3.11.
You can install Python either through the Anaconda
package manager (see below ), Homebrew , or
the Python website .
In one of the upcoming PyTorch releases, support for Python 3.8 will be deprecated.
Package Manager
To install the PyTorch binaries, you will need to use one of two supported package managers: Anaconda or pip . Anaconda is the recommended package manager as it will provide you all of the PyTorch dependencies in one, sandboxed install, including Python.
Anaconda
To install Anaconda, you can download graphical installer or use the command-line installer. If you use the command-line installer, you can right-click on the installer link, select Copy Link Address, or use the following commands on Intel Mac:
# The version of Anaconda may be different depending on when you are installing` curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh # and follow the prompts. The defaults are generally good.`
or following commands on M1 Mac:
# The version of Anaconda may be different depending on when you are installing` curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh # and follow the prompts. The defaults are generally good.`
pip
Python 3
If you installed Python via Homebrew or the Python website, pip was installed with it. If you installed Python 3.x, then you will be using the command pip3.
Tip: If you want to use just the command pip, instead of pip3, you can symlink pip to the pip3 binary.
Installation
To install PyTorch via Anaconda, use the following conda command:
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip
To install PyTorch via pip, use one of the following two commands, depending on your Python version:
# Python 3.x pip3 install torch torchvision
Verification
To ensure that PyTorch was installed correctly, we can verify the installation by running sample PyTorch code. Here we will construct a randomly initialized tensor.
import torch x = torch.rand(5, 3) print(x)
The output should be something similar to:
tensor([[0.3380, 0.3845, 0.3217],
        [0.8337, 0.9050, 0.2650],
        [0.2979, 0.7141, 0.9069],
        [0.1449, 0.1132, 0.1375],
        [0.4675, 0.3947, 0.1426]])
Building from source
For the majority of PyTorch users, installing from a pre-built binary via a package manager will provide the best experience. However, there are times when you may want to install the bleeding edge PyTorch code, whether for testing or actual development on the PyTorch core. To install the latest PyTorch code, you will need to build PyTorch from source .
Prerequisites
Follow the steps described here: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source
You can verify the installation as described above .
Installing on Linux
PyTorch can be installed and used on various Linux distributions. Depending on your system and compute requirements, your experience with PyTorch on Linux may vary in terms of processing time. It is recommended, but not required, that your Linux system has an NVIDIA or AMD GPU in order to harness the full power of PyTorch’s CUDA support or ROCm support.
Prerequisites
Arch Linux , minimum version 2012-07-15
CentOS , minimum version 7.3-1611
Slackware , minimum version 14.2
Ubuntu , minimum version 13.04
The install instructions here will generally apply to all supported Linux distributions. An example difference is that your distribution may support yum instead of apt. The specific examples shown were run on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine.
Python
Python 3.8-3.11 is generally installed by default on any of our supported Linux distributions, which meets our recommendation.
Tip: By default, you will have to use the command python3 to run Python. If you want to use just the command python, instead of python3, you can symlink python to the python3 binary.
However, if you want to install another version, there are multiple ways:
APT
If you decide to use APT, you can run the following command to install it:
sudo apt install python
If you use Anaconda to install PyTorch, it will install a sandboxed version of Python that will be used for running PyTorch applications.
Package Manager
To install the PyTorch binaries, you will need to use one of two supported package managers: Anaconda or pip . Anaconda is the recommended package manager as it will provide you all of the PyTorch dependencies in one, sandboxed install, including Python.
Anaconda
To install Anaconda, you will use the command-line installer . Right-click on the 64-bit installer link, select Copy Link Location, and then use the following commands:
# The version of Anaconda may be different depending on when you are installing` curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh # and follow the prompts. The defaults are generally good.`
You may have to open a new terminal or re-source your ~/.bashrc to get access to the conda command.
pip
While Python 3.x is installed by default on Linux, pip is not installed by default.
sudo apt install python3-pip
Tip: If you want to use just the command pip, instead of pip3, you can symlink pip to the pip3 binary.
Installation
Anaconda
No CUDA/ROCm
To install PyTorch via Anaconda, and do not have a CUDA-capable or ROCm-capable system or do not require CUDA/ROCm (i.e. GPU support), in the above selector, choose OS: Linux, Package: Conda, Language: Python and Compute Platform: CPU.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.
With CUDA
To install PyTorch via Anaconda, and you do have a CUDA-capable system, in the above selector, choose OS: Linux, Package: Conda and the CUDA version suited to your machine. Often, the latest CUDA version is better.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.
With ROCm
PyTorch via Anaconda is not supported on ROCm currently. Please use pip instead.
pip
No CUDA
To install PyTorch via pip, and do not have a CUDA-capable or ROCm-capable system or do not require CUDA/ROCm (i.e. GPU support), in the above selector, choose OS: Linux, Package: Pip, Language: Python and Compute Platform: CPU.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.

        [0.4675, 0.3947, 0.1426]])
Additionally, to check if your GPU driver and CUDA/ROCm is enabled and accessible by PyTorch, run the following commands to return whether or not the GPU driver is enabled (the ROCm build of PyTorch uses the same semantics at the python API level (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/docs/source/notes/hip.rst#hip-interfaces-reuse-the-cuda-interfaces), so the below commands should also work for ROCm):
import torch torch.cuda.is_available()
