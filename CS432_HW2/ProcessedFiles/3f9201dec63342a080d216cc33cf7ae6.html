Ordering from AE for around 10 years!
Iâve been ordering for over close to a decade and each time has been a wonderful experience. Any issues are usually cleared up by seller fast and without much fuss. Only had a few orders that were ridiculous and tiny such as stationery ephemera but that accounts for maybe 3 of thousands of items. I have no hesitation now to place orders, but do be sure to read the reviews. Sometimes you miss details that were overlooked or extra images were not shown on the listing.  Huge tip: call your bank and do a prior authorization on this site so they donât flag and refuse orders and or close your account down. I had to verify each order I had made that first time and then place a standing order so now it is no issue at all to place orders at all times. Tracking is impressive with alerts of shipping, customs, eta for delivery and when itâs at the home sorting facility that will make final delivery plus a delivery confirmation on the app and in an email. Tip 2â¦. Always follow stores you like to get an additional dollar off an order and to add coupons. There are often buy $x amount and get free shipping and buy increments and get $1-20 off orders. Use that to save even more. I try to get the items with free shipping first choice but will go to a seller that offers free shipping when I reached a $12-26 purchase threshold.

Do your research but great venders are available
Iâve been shopping with Ali for over 8 years and Iâve had some bad experiences but very few. Iâve gotten great vendors to do business with!! Do your research and donât just look for the best pictures especially when it comes to beauty products!!! A lot of the pictures are circulating from different websites and they are misleading!! You can ask for samples but that definitely doesnât always mean youâre going to get that product they sent. Read the last few months of reviews and check out the pictures on that particular vendor. They always ask you to take a picture of the product and upload it so they can get a really great review and it drives business their way!! This is also a way to get some of your money back a few bucks like 20-30 dollars for your review and pictures. If you donât like the product let them know immediately and try to work things out without having to file a dispute. Reason why, simply put youâre most likely going to be back and forth and if you donât have sold proof that the product is bad or the company has a reputation for selling bad product youâre not gonna win that dispute and if you do itâs not gonna be what you paid for that product. Communication is everything, so is humility! Thanks

Tamara Himes orders
My hoodies were all nice i worry two may be small but I wonât know till Christmas. Nightgown was to small and not what I order style was wrong so I got refund. PokÃ©mon tin I never got ask for refund cause box of cards were open bent were smashed they had moisture in the wrap. I ask for tin with refund and you only gave me some of my money back instead of making my order right by sending the tins I ordered these were gifts . The book and tins w/cards were for my boys. I still needed to order 5 books . But after this I wonât try your sights are to small you canât really make out what your getting but my order even said with tin box so you should of sent me the 3 boxes not some of my money. The ornaments I thought were figures not flat plastic it didnât state that on sight. I ask for refund and got it. Your dispute doesnât give you the option to say you got wrong thing would like it fixed with the right thing . I spent over $200 with all my orders. Very happy with the shirts I recieved . But still waiting on two tee shirts and a hoodie and siren figures . Pokemon was your mistake and Iâm out cause you chose to only send some of my money instead of sending me what I ordered I never got the tin w/cards they were what my boys ask for I canât find them in the stores there sold out. The hoodies  were the only thing that were like what that showed. I was only told this shipped I got the stuff before I was notified where it was got up date 4 days after recieved.
