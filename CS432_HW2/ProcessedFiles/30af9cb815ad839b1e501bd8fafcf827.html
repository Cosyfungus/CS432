boycotting The Bachelor
false
Genuinely, I’m so tired of ABC’s decisions for male leads. I’m done. I want their numbers to plummet so badly for this upcoming season. I don’t want them to be able to ignore the fact that no one wanted this. They had an extra hour of the show tonight and decidedly didn’t mention anything about Erich’s acts of racism — yet spent THIS much time on the new Bachelor. I just want to scream. The show is supposed to light and fun but it’s just shit at this point, and they’re not doing anything to overhaul how unsatisfying and disingenuous their entire franchise has become.
SPOILER: No one wants _____. He is a boring, basic white man who offers nothing to us as an audience. I’ve never been this passionate or outspoken about their choice for a lead before, but I just needed to say this. I’m so disappointed.
