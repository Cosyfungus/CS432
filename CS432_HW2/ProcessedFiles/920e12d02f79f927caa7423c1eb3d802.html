Sister Wives Timeline - **Spoilers**
false
I organized/combined the sub's timeline posts. I was trying to figure out when Kody melted the ring in relation to other events, then this happened. Most of this information is from other posts on this sub. Thanks OPs! I have so many better things to do, but it's raining and I don't feel well. :)
