Wikimedia projects belong to everyone
You made it. It is yours to use. For free. That means you can use it, adapt it, or share what you find on Wikimedia sites. Just do not write your own bio , or copy/paste it into your homework.

People like you keep Wikipedia accurate
Readers verify the facts . Articles are collaboratively created and edited by a community of volunteers using reliable sources , so no single person or company owns a Wikipedia article. The Wikimedia Foundation does not write or edit, but you and everyone you know can help .

Not all wikis are Wikimedia
The word “ wiki ” refers to a website built using collaborative editing software. Projects with no past or existing affiliation with Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Foundation, such as Wikileaks and wikiHow, also use the term. Although these sites also use “wiki” in their name, they have nothing to do with Wikimedia.
