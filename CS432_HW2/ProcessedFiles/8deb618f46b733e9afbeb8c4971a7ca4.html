This subreddit is a place to share news, information, resources, and support that relate to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes called COVID-19. The primary focus of this sub is to actively monitor the situation in Australia and New Zealand, but all posts on international news and other virus-related topics are welcome, to the extent they are beneficial in keeping those down under informed.
