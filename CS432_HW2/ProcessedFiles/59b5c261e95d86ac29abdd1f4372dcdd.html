The future of whole home comfort is here.
Innovation that’s close to home
The future of whole-home comfort is here. Samsung is innovating the world of HVAC.
For the average household, almost half of the annual energy usage is used by a home’s heating and cooling system. That’s why energy efficiency is one of the most important benefits homeowners are looking for in a heating and cooling system.
Many parts of the country are adopting electrification/decarbonization efforts and “outlawing” the use of gas products in the home, which includes the gas furnace, so homeowners will need to find an alternative for their heating needs.
Samsung HVAC systems are designed with innovative technologies that environmentally conscious consumers can confidently use to save energy and reduce their carbon footprint. No matter what your needs are, Samsung has a solution.

Hylex™
The Hylex™ whole system allows you to use existing HVAC equipment already in the home Popular configuration options: Configured for cooling-only to mirror the functionality of a traditional unitary ODU that is paired with a gas furnace for heat. Even when used for cooling-only, homeowners benefit from the variable speed operation of the inverter compressor that will run at the necessary speed to meet and maintain the set temperature rather than turning on/off to meet the set temperature like a traditional 1-stage or 2-stage cube/unitary ODU. Resulting in better efficiency, more consistent temperatures and energy/cost savings.
Configured for heating and cooling which eliminates the need for a gas furnace to provide heat OR you can configure the system as dual-fuel which would use electric heat to a certain ambient temperature and then switch to the gas furnace if the system can’t keep up with the demand.
FJM
Free Joint Multi
Samsung’s FJM is a multi-zone heat pump system which allows homeowners to “zone” or divide their home into independently controlled temperature zones using multiple indoor units for enhanced efficiency and comfort. For example, an indoor unit can be dedicated to treating a single or multiple bedrooms in a home so occupants who enjoy colder temperatures at night can cool that zone to 68 degrees without paying to cool the entire home to 68 degrees like they would with a traditional central air system. This saves energy and helps reduce energy costs, regardless of the time of year.
The FJM heat pump system provides both heating and cooling, eliminating the need for a gas furnace to supply heat for your home and providing even greater savings. This energy-efficient, customizable, and convenient heating and cooling system is the perfect solution for homeowners looking to upgrade their HVAC system to comply with local electrification initiatives.
Looking to treat a single room or add-on?
Consider installing a ductless mini split system. Mini split systems provide a simple way to heat and cool a single area and are often more efficient, less invasive and offer greater control over the temperature in the space compared to a traditional central air system.

The WindFree™ unit delivers an air current that is under 0.15 m/s while in WindFree™ mode. Air velocity that is below 0.15 m/s is considered "still air" as defined by ASHRAE 55-2013 (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers). Select models are Energy Star® labeled. Proper sizing and installation of equipment is critical to achieve performance. Split system air conditioners and heat pumps (excluding ductless systems) must be matched with appropriate coil components to meet ENERGY STAR® criteria.
