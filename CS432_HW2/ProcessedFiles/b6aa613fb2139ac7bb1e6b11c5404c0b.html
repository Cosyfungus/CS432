Incident with Pull Requests, Actions and Issues
Resolved - On March 1, 2024, between 14:17 UTC and 15:54 UTC the service that sends messages from our event stream into our background job processing service was degraded and delayed the transmission of jobs for processing.  No data or jobs were lost.  From 14:17 to 14:41 UTC, there was a partial degradation, where customers would experience intermittent delays with PRs and Actions.  From 14:41 to 15:24 UTC, 36% of PRs users saw stale data, and 100% of in progress Actions workflows did not see updates , even though the workflows were succeeding.  At 15:24 UTC, we mitigated the incident by redeploying our service and jobs began to burn down, with full job catchup by 15:54 UTC. This was due to under provisioned memory and lack of memory based back pressure in the service, which overwhelmed consumers and led to OutOfMemory crashes.We have adjusted memory configurations to prevent this problem, and are analyzing and adjusting our alert sensitivity to reduce our time to detection of issues like this one in the future.

Incident with Issues, Webhooks and Actions
Resolved - On February 29, 2024, between 9:32 and 11:54 UTC, queuing in our background job service caused processing delays to Webhooks, Actions, and Issues. Nearly 95% of delays occurred between 11:05 and 11:27 UTC, with 5% during the remainder of the incident. During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: 50% of webhooks experienced delays of up to 5m, 1% of webhooks experienced delays of 17m at peak; Actions: on average, 7% of customers experienced delays, with a peak of 44%; and many Issues saw a delay in appearing in searches. At 9:32 UTC our automated failover successfully routed traffic to a secondary cluster. But an improper restoration to primary at 10:32 UTC caused a significant increase in queued jobs until 11:21 UTC, when a correction was made and healthy services began burning down the backlog until full resolution.We have made improvements to the automation and reliability of our fallback process to prevent recurrence. We also have larger work already in progress to improve the overall reliability of our job processing platform.
